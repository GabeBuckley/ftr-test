                <h2>Help</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to fibbr, an app that determines if an entered number is one of the first 1000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci numbers</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially you will be asked to set a timer interval. This interval governs the length of time between display updates. You can halt and resume the timer at any point during the demonstration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there, you will be asked to enter a sequence of positive whole integers (that is to say... numbers). If you enter a number that is part of the Fibonacci sequence, the word FIB will appear. If the number you entered is not part of the Fibonacci sequence,
                    then the word FIB will not appear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The numbers you have entered into the system will be updated on screen according to the interval you set up at the start. They will be ordered by the number of times you have entered that particular number (the frequency), in descending order.
                </p>
                <p>To end the demonstration you can either hit the Quit button, close your browser window, or dunk your laptop in the bath. We recommend the Quit button.</p>
